SDEV-140-Final-Project GitHub Repository for SDEV 140 Final Project GUI Application

The name of the GUI application. Workout Recommendation App

What is the purpose of the Application? I am creating this application as a way for people to find a way to lose, gain, or maintain weight based on their height, weight, and activity level. The reason is some people have no knowledge or experience in exercising and dietary methods. It takes research to learn how our bodies work and I want to simpify that.

What do you want the Application to accomplish? List the goals you have for the Application. I want the application to tell the user how to gain, lose, or maintain their weight based on their height, weight, and activity level. The goal is to recommend the user methods on how to gain, lose, or maintain weight.

Who is your target audience? Describe your target audience by age, gender, socioeconomic characteristics, and so on. My target audience is individuals who do not know how the body works, and who have no experience in working out. It takes some research and self-experience to see how your body reacts to different methods of gaining, losing, and maintaining weight. This targets people who need a little helpful start on their journey to their body goal.
